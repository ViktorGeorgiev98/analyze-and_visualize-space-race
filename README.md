# Space Mission Data Analysis
## This project involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset of space missions from nextspaceflight.com, covering all space missions since the beginning of the Space Race in 1957. The dataset includes detailed information on mission status (success/failure), mission costs, number of launches by country, and many other relevant attributes.

### The aim of this project is to explore trends and insights from the data and answer various questions, including but not limited to:

- Who launched the most missions in any given year?

- How has the cost of space missions varied over time?

- Which months are the most popular for launches?

- Have space missions gotten safer or has the chance of failure remained unchanged?

And many more questions regarding the evolution and trends in the space industry.

This analysis leverages data visualization tools and statistical methods to answer these questions and uncover valuable insights into the history of space exploration.



## Key Questions Explored
- Dominant Organisations: Which organisations or countries have launched the most missions over the years?

- Cost of Missions: How has the cost of a space mission evolved over time? Are there any trends that can be identified?

- Launch Trends: What months see the most space missions, and what factors contribute to these trends?

- Safety Trends: Have space missions become safer over time? What has been the trend in failure rates and how have organisations worked to minimise risks?

- Mission Success and Failure: What are the trends in mission success and failure rates across different organisations and years?

## Technologies Used
- Python (for data analysis and manipulation)

- Pandas (for data processing and manipulation)

- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for creating visualizations and charts)

- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis and documentation)
